## Lab2 RPC Model

```
Simplest failure-handling scheme: "best effort"
  Call() waits for response for a while
  If none arrives, re-send the request
  Do this a few times
  Then give up and return an error
```

```
A particularly bad situation:
  client executes
    Put("k", 10);
    Put("k", 20);
  both succeed
  what will Get("k") yield?
  [diagram, timeout, re-send, original arrives late]
```

（后发先至，旧覆盖新）

```
Better RPC behavior: "at most once"
  idea: server RPC code detects duplicate requests
    returns previous reply instead of re-running handler
  Q: how to detect a duplicate request?
  client includes unique ID (XID) with each request
    uses same XID for re-send
  server:
    if seen[xid]:
      r = old[xid]
    else
      r = handler()
      old[xid] = r
      seen[xid] = true
```

（response 缓存）

```
some at-most-once complexities
  this will come up in lab 3
  what if two clients use the same XID?
    big random number?
    combine unique client ID (ip address?) with sequence #?
  server must eventually discard info about old RPCs
    when is discard safe?
    idea:
      each client has a unique ID (perhaps a big random number)
      per-client RPC sequence numbers
      client includes "seen all replies <= X" with every RPC
      much like TCP sequence #s and acks
    or only allow client one outstanding RPC at a time
      arrival of seq+1 allows server to discard all <= seq
  how to handle dup req while original is still executing?
    server doesn't know reply yet
    idea: "pending" flag per executing RPC; wait or ignore
```

（ID 唯一性；缓存清除策略）

```
What if an at-most-once server crashes and re-starts?
  if at-most-once duplicate info in memory, server will forget
    and accept duplicate requests after re-start
  maybe it should write the duplicate info to disk
  maybe replica server should also replicate duplicate info
```

## Lab3 GFS

```
What would we like for consistency?
  Ideal model: same behavior as a single server
  server uses disk storage
  server executes client operations one at a time (even if concurrent)
  reads reflect previous writes
    even if server crashes and restarts
  thus:
    suppose C1 and C2 write concurrently, and after the writes have
      completed, C3 and C4 read. what can they see?
    C1: Wx1
    C2: Wx2
    C3:     Rx?
    C4:         Rx?
    answer: either 1 or 2, but both have to see the same value.
  This is a "strong" consistency model.
  But a single server has poor fault-tolerance.
