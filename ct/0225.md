To prove something is not computable

# 2 math tasks: Proof Algorithm/effective computational procedures for solving problems
is every function computable?

## Diophantine equations 
ax+by=c solution exists <=> gcd(a,b) | c  
For any polynomial Diophantine equation, no algorithm is known for solving this problem(unsolvable).  

## Algorithm
for calculating a function  
follow a machine initial -> states -> end  
is it possible to verify algorithm?  it is unsolvable.  
Consider functions from N to N. Is there a definite algorithm that computes the functional value for any given x? Asume there is. Order all algorithm instructions. Ei - fi
let g(x) = fx(x)+1. then g(x) is not in instruction list. qed. g(x) well defined but not effectively computable.

No algorithm decides whether an algorithm computes f(x)
